## Course on
# Tides and its applications in Oceanography

##About the course:

*In this course, we intend to introduce the basics of the physics of tides and the methods of tidal data analysis. Additionally, we are keen on providing an overview on quality control of tidal data and an introduction to tide modelling. This would be beneficial to oceanographers engaged in studying tidal forecasting, design and planning of coastal structures, storm-surge and inundation, coastal circulation, sea-level rise, spatio-temporal variability of sea-level as well as ocean dynamics. The training will include lecture sessions by specialists and hands on practical sessionsi*

##Course contents:

### The Lectures will tentatively cover the following topics:

1. General introduction to tides and the physics of tides in real oceans.
2. Propagation of tides along continental shelf, shallow water and coastal region.
3. Application of sea level data analysis in Oceanography
4. Impact of the atmosphere on sea-level
5. Modern techniques of sea-level observations
6. Modelling of tides at global and regional scales

### Practical Sessions on:

1. Tidal analysis and prediction
2. Harmonic analysis for oceanographic applications.
3. Near-shore tide modelling
